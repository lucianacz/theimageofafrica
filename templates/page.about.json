She accomplished her photography degree with excellence in the department of journalism and social communications in Dublin, Ireland and had been living in Moscow, London and New York before she settled in Tanzania as a volunteer. There she discovered her true passion for African cultures and exploration of remote places. Her experience of Tanzanian ‘wonderland’ and its unexplored interior had led her to create a travel company that would give a chance to like-minded individuals to experience what she has been experiencing up to this day. This strong, powerful feeling from interaction with African cultures has become the main driving force for deep exploration of Tanzania, and therefore she wants to pass and share her knowledge with guests by crafting off-the-beaten-track routes. She believes that this mind-transforming experience, humane and gentle approach to cultural interactions as well as closeness to nature and wildlife is indeed the future of tourism in Africa and in Tanzania in particular.<\/p>",
