She accomplished her photography degree with excellence in the department of journalism and social communications in Dublin, Ireland and had been living in Moscow, London and New York before she settled in Tanzania as a volunteer. There she discovered her true passion for African cultures and exploration of remote places. Her experience of Tanzanian ‘wonderland’ and its unexplored interior had led her to create a travel company that would give a chance to like-minded individuals to experience what she has been experiencing up to this day. This strong, powerful feeling from interaction with African cultures has become the main driving force for deep exploration of Tanzania, and therefore she wants to pass and share her knowledge with guests by crafting off-the-beaten-track routes. She believes that this mind-transforming experience, humane and gentle approach to cultural interactions as well as closeness to nature and wildlife is indeed the future of tourism in Africa and in Tanzania in particular.<\/p>",

He started his career at a young age helping national and international researchers to explore the Lake Eyasi basin and the cultures that live around the area. Momoya belongs to the Datoga tribe and grew up between Lake Eyasi and Karatu. While growing up in a farmer's family he got to learn the neighboring tribes’ languages. His father was the first one in the Eyasi area to host a researcher from abroad, that’s when Momoya first time realized the value of the cultural heritage of his country. As part of his pastoralist legacy, Momoya is used to traveling long distances within Tanzania, which led him to get to know other cultures of the country. Nowadays he is one of the main references for cultural tourism in Northern Tanzania and is one of the pioneers of cultural tourism in Tanzania. It is important to note that before the emergence of the community tourism in the area, the Lake Eyasi basin was one of the hunting destinations for foreigners, which affected the life of the Hadzabe hunter-gatherers. Momoya fought against the hunting activity and trained younger guides in order for them to carry out the tourist activity by themself and protect the cultural heritage in Northern Tanzania.<\/p>",
