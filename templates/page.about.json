The time came to share all the experience he had gained. These goals started to come to life when he met Antonina - the other co-founder and CEO of the company. Antonina is a travel lover and a photographer with over 10 years of experience working on commissioned assignments from various publications. Her passion and work lead her to discover breath-taking places and to live together with some of the most remote communities in Tanzania. <strong>The Image of Africa<\/strong> started when these two people met in Tanzania and decided that their journey together was about to begin.<\/p>",
